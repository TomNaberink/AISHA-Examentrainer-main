      "inhoud_html": "<p>by Andrew Griffin</p><p>A Japanese insurance company, Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance, is replacing its staff with an artificial intelligence system. The move, which will see more than 30 people sacked to make way for the computer, is being seen as one of the clearest examples of the coming changes that robots and machines will bring to the workplace.</p><p>The computer will be used to calculate how much policyholders should be paid out. For now, the calculations will only be used as a way of saving time by reducing how long it takes to work out payouts. Those calculations will still need to be signed off by a human. But even doing that will allow the company to save about 140 million yen, or Â£1 million, per year.</p><p>Japan hopes that by introducing more robots into its workforce it can address the problem of its shrinking and rapidly ageing population. Artificial intelligence machines are going to be integrated into the work of government from next month, helping ministers look up answers to questions and cutting out the work done by civil servants.</p><small>independent.co.uk, 2017</small>"

However, while enjoying\nthe same films and having similar taste in\nrestaurants might seem important, the real test of a\nstrong friendship could lie in your genetics. This is\nbecause friends are more genetically similar than\nstrangers, claims a new study published in the\nNational Academy of Sciences.</p><p>2 After carrying out a series of genetic\n\ncomparisons between pairs of friends, the researchers found a lot of\ngenetic similarities between them, far more than between pairs who didn't\nknow each other. They also found that friends were on average around\ntwo-thirds as genetically similar as married couples.</p><p>3 This might be\nbecause people are drawn to those with whom they have shared\ncharacteristics such as similar backgrounds, levels of education or being\nof a similar height and/or weight. Another explanation they suggest is that people tend to form\nfriendships within shared social environments. 11, they may attend the\nsame school or live in the same community. This is known as social\nstructuring, the authors write.</p><p>4 The two explanations might also\ncomplement one another. However, lead author Stanford professor\nBenjamin Domingue concluded that the latter, which might be more\nsubconscious, could be more influential in forming friendships. \"Are individuals actively selecting to be around people who are like\nthem, or is it due to impersonal forces, such as social structures, that we\nall are affected by?\" he asked. \"Our evidence, with respect to friends,\nsuggest that it's largely the effect of shared social environments.\"</p><small>The Independent, 2018</small>"

A day later,\nDr. Collicott replied, and Ms. Samudio was surprised by his answer:\n\"Instead of guessing, why not 18\"</p><p>3 Blue Origin, a rocket company, was planning to offer the ability for schools\nto fly small experiments on its New Shepard suborbital spacecraft for as\nlittle as \\$8,000. Dr. Collicott, who had sent several fluid flow experiments\non New Shepard launches, pointed Ms. Samudio and her second-graders\nto Blue Origin. \"For half the cost of high school football uniforms we were\nable to do a space experiment,\" Dr. Collicott said. \"So really any school\ndistrict now that affords football, and there are many of those, can afford\nspaceflight.\"</p><p>4 Cumberland Elementary has not been the only school to see the value of\npaying for an experiment aboard the New Shepard rocket. A Montessori\nmiddle school in Colorado sent up a sensor package designed and\nprogrammed by the students. An Alabama high school launched an\nexperiment to test temperature fluctuations in microgravity. And this past\nDecember, an elementary school in Ohio sent up baby jellyfish.</p><p>5 Following Dr. Collicott's suggestion, Ms. Samudio's children at\nCumberland got to work, collaborating with Purdue students in\nDr. Collicott's classes. \"For the next two years, I had future aeronautical\nengineers in my second-grade classroom teaching mini-lessons on basic\nprinciples of flight and propulsion as well as the basic principles of 'firefly'\nchemistry,\" Ms. Samudio said.</p><p>6 On Dec. 12, 2017, the firefly experiment was on board New Shepard. It\ndid not contain any actual fireflies. \"It appears when scared, fireflies don't\nlight up,\" Dr. Collicott said. \"And we were concerned that the boost would\nscare them. And then there's also the problem that I don't know how to\nkeep fireflies alive and keep them happy.\" Instead, the apparatus\nreplicated the chemistry of how fireflies generate light, with syringes\nmixing the glow-creating substances together as the capsule reached the\ntop of the trajectory more than 60 miles above West Texas. A video\ncamera recorded what happened. Dr. Collicott attended the launch, and\ntwo days later, was back in Ms. Samudio's classroom presenting the\nresults.

The ship was torpedoed off\nthe coast of Ireland by a German U-boat on 16 February 1941. The ship\nlay nearly three miles deep until 2011, when Odyssey Marine Exploration,\na US firm that won the contract from the British government in 2010 for\nsalvage, discovered it. The company recovered more than 100 tonnes of\nsilver from the wreck, along with the letters. The missives had been\nsealed within the hold under tons of mailbags and sediments, protected\nfrom light, currents, heat and oxygen, and stayed mostly intact.</p><p>3 \"It's an environment without oxygen so the corrosion is slowed down\ncompletely. And because there were so many mailbags together, a\nmassive percentage of the whole post office mail would have been\ndestroyed, but a central part of all this big bundle of mailbags has\nsurvived,\" said conservator Eleni Katsiani. While a handful of the more\ncomplete letters from the ship were displayed in an exhibition at the\nPostal Museum in London, the museum's archive team have been working\non some of the more damaged specimens over recent months, piecing\ntogether fragments to reveal glimpses of wartime lives.</p><p>4 The letters were immediately freeze-dried after the discovery, to stop the\ndecay process. They were also washed in freshwater to get the salt out,\nsaid Katsiani, \"an intense and 24-1 process for each letter but one\nthat secured their current condition and therefore worth all the hours of\nwork.\" The Postal Museum's senior paper conservator, Jackie Coppen,\ncame across the letter to Iris, which she described as \"a tender testament\nto love and longing, written on incredibly thin and fragile paper. Like many\nof the letters, it has suffered, but despite 24-2 areas, enough remains\nto appreciate the sentiments,\" Coppen said. \"It talks of hope and the\nfuture, it professes dreams of embracing tightly and being together again.\nIt evokes a romantic past, when the handwritten word sent through the\npost was often the only means of 24-3 long-distance relationships.\"</p><p>5 Under half of the letters have now been worked on by the conservators,\ngiving, as the museum puts it, \"insight into the lives of ordinary people,\nliving in extraordinary circumstances during the Second World War.\" \"There were missionaries, business people, soldiers and generals writing,\nordinary travellers who had gone to India,\" said Katsiani. \"The letters are\ntalking about life, love, faith, business and the weather, of course.\" \"It\nfeels somewhat touching and appropriate to be uniting these letters on the\n80th anniversary of the ship's sinking,\" said Coppen. \"It is inevitable that\nwhile piecing the letters together I have come to form an intimate\nrelationship with them they are mesmerising and capture a remarkable\nsnippet of life during a most significant period.\"</p><small>theguardian.com, 2021</small>"

It is \"arguably the world's largest living\norganism,\" writes Kate Golembiewski for the New York Times.</p><p>3 As part of a survey, researchers collected samples from ten seagrass\nmeadows across Western Australia's Shark Bay, about 500 miles north of\nPerth, and studied 18,000 genetic markers to test how many different\nplants grew in the area.</p><p>5\n\n\"Polyploid plants often reside in places with extreme environmental\nconditions, are often sterile, but can continue to grow if left undisturbed,\nand this giant seagrass has done just that,\" Sinclair says. \"Even without\nsuccessful flowering and seed production, it appears to be really resilient,\nexperiencing a wide range of temperatures and saltiness plus extreme\n\nhigh light conditions, which together would typically be highly stressful for\nmost plants.\"</p><p>6 In 2010 and 2011, a heatwave hit Western Australia, damaging Shark\nBay's seagrass meadows. Though the ribbon weed was impacted, it has\nalready begun to recover, the study shows. \"This is somewhat surprising,\nas this seagrass does not appear to reproduce sexually which would\nnormally be the best way to adapt to changing conditions,\" write the\nresearchers in The Conversation. The scientists suspect that the seagrass\nis extremely well-adapted to its local environment, on the edge of its\nspecies' range. In places like these, species that reproduce by cloning\nthemselves rapidly and repeatedly may adapt better \nand more quickly\nthan species that reproduce sexually, which can be a slower process.</p><p>7 Seagrasses help purify water, are carbon sinks and host a large number\nof other species, which is why they are important to protect, Marlene\nJahnke, a biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who was\nnot involved in the research, tells The Times.</p><small>smithsonianmag.com, 2022</small>"
