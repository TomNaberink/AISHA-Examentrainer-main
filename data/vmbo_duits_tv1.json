Caves aren't unusual in the Wye Valley. But when they looked a little closer, Gore and his team realised it wasn't a cave at all. They had found a stone tunnel.</p><p><strong>3</strong> \"When we got there, and we'd seen that part of the side of the banking had caved in, you could see straight away that it was something that was man-made,\" said Gore. The tunnel followed a route along the Anghidi River towards Tintern Abbey, the 12th-Century abbey built by Cistercian monks. \"It was underneath a public footpath, a huge number of people had been walking over it forever how long that footpath had been there and no-one knew what they were walking on top of,\" said Western Power Distribution wayleave officer Luke Summers. Western Power Distribution called in Cadw, the Welsh historic monuments body. Cadw estimated the tunnel to have been built around the 14th Century. The energy firm stopped the project to allow for proper archaeological investigation.</p><p><strong>4</strong> Though an adult couldn't walk upright - footage of the section shows a space about 4ft in height - the arching stonework tunnel appears to be large enough to have allowed people to move undetected through the countryside. Draped in cobwebs and stippled with puddles, the tunnel yielded few of its secrets in the initial exploration. It will take more investigation to accurately date the hidden historical structure and to determine just what this mysterious subterranean passage might have been used for.</p><small>bbc.com, 2021</small>"

        "inhoud_html": "<p><strong>1</strong> Sitting atop a cliff in the Canary Islands, Antonio Márquez Navarro issued an invitation \"Come over here, we're going to slaughter the pig\" without speaking a word: He whistled it. In the distance, three visiting hikers stopped dead in their tracks at the piercing sound and its echo bouncing off the walls of the ravine that separated them. Mr. Márquez, 71, said that in his youth, when local shepherds rather than tourists walked the steep and rugged footpaths of his island, his news would have been greeted right away by a responding whistle, loud and clear.</p><p><strong>2</strong> But his message was lost on these hikers, and they soon resumed their trek on La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands, a volcanic archipelago in the Atlantic that is part of Spain. Mr. Márquez is a proud guardian of La Gomera's whistling language, which he called \"the poetry of my island.\" And, he added, \"like poetry, whistling does not need to be useful in order to be special and beautiful.\"</p><p><strong>3</strong> With its __18__ it's easy to see why whistling came into use on the Canaries; on most of the islands, deep ravines run from high peaks and plateaus down to the ocean, and plenty of time and effort are required to travel even a short distance overland. Whistling developed as a good alternative way to deliver a message, with its sound carrying farther than shouting as much as two miles across some canyons and with favorable wind conditions.</p><p><strong>4</strong> In 2009, La Gomera's whistled language, officially known as Silbo Gomero, was added by UNESCO to its list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. But with whistling no longer essential for communication, Silbo's survival mostly relies on a 1999 law that made teaching it an obligatory part of the island's school curriculum.</p><p><strong>5</strong> Interpreting a whistle isn't always easy but making the correct sounds can be even harder. Most whistlers insert one bent knuckle into the mouth, but some use instead the tip of one or two fingers, while a few use a finger from each hand. \"The only rule is to find whichever finger makes it easier to whistle, and sometimes unfortunately nothing works at all,\" said Francisco Correa, who is a fluent whistler. \"There are even some older people who have understood Silbo perfectly since childhood, but never got any clear sound to come out of their mouth.\"</p><p><strong>6</strong> As is the case in many languages, whether whistled or not, there is a generation gap on La Gomera. Ciro Mesa Niebla, a 46-year-old farmer, said he struggled to whistle with a younger generation trained at school because, he said, \"I'm a mountain guy who learned at home to whistle the words our family used to farm, but I don't have the vocabulary of these kids who learn salon whistling, which is a bit too fancy for me.\"</p><p><strong>7</strong> The students don't always have much opportunity to practice Silbo outside of school. In the class of 6-year-olds, only five of 17 raised their hands when asked if they had a chance to whistle at home. \"My brother actually can whistle really loudly, but he won't show me, because he is either on his PlayStation or out with friends,\" complained one of the youngsters, Laura Mesa Mendoza. Still, there are teenagers who welcome the chance to chat without many of the adults around them understanding. Some had parents who went to school before acquiring Silbo became mandatory, or who settled on the island as adults.</p><p><strong>8</strong> However much she is attached to her cellphone, Erin Gerhards, 15, is another example of someone keen to improve her whistling and help safeguard the traditions of her island. \"It is a way to honor the people that lived here in the past,\" she said. \"And to remember where everything came from, that we didn't start with technology, but from simple beginnings.\"</p><small>adapted from chicagotribune.com, 2021</small>"

        "inhoud_html": "<p><strong>by JASON BITTEL</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong> Since King Kong first appeared on the silver screen in 1933, the fictional giant ape has exposed audiences all over the world to a very real gorilla behavior chest-beating. \"It is __21__,\" says Edward Wright, a primatologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It can be a bit frightening. You don't want to get in the way.\"</p><p><strong>2</strong> Mountain gorillas live in tight-knit family groups led by silverback males, whose authority is constantly being challenged by other males. By advertising their size, mating status, and fighting ability via sounds that can travel long distances through thick rainforests, the silverbacks are signaling would-be challengers that they better think again before starting a ruckus.</p><p><strong>3</strong> To study the behavior in never-before-seen detail, Wright and his colleagues spent more than 3,000 hours observing endangered mountain gorillas at Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. While battling biting insects and navigating the park's rugged, mountainous terrain, the scientists observed more than 500 chest beats from 25 different males between 2014 and 2016. They stayed at a safe distance from the animals, which have been accustomed to the presence of researchers but remain highly vulnerable to human diseases.</p><p><strong>4</strong> The results showed that the biggest mountain gorillas produced sounds with lower frequencies than smaller gorillas - possibly because bigger gorillas have larger air sacs near their larynx. This means that chest- beating isn't just a visual display, but what the study calls an \"honest signal of competitive ability\". Although previous studies showed that a gorilla's body size is linked to dominance and reproductive success, the idea that chest-beating also communicates some of that information remained speculative. \"We thought and suspected it, but there was no actual data to support this claim,\" says Roberta Salmi, a primatologist and director of the Primate Behavioral Ecology Lab at the University of Georgia, who is unaffiliated with the research. \"I was happy to finally see those results.\"</p><p><strong>5</strong> Though chest-beating is common in movies and other pop culture portrayals, there's still plenty we get wrong about the behavior. For starters, real-life gorillas don't strike their chests with balled up fists. Rather, they cup their hands, which amplifies the sounds. By cupping their hands they ensure that the thumps can be heard more than half a mile away. Silverbacks beat their chests most often when females under their protection are most ready to mate. But it's not like males are banging on the drum all day, as they're often portrayed doing in movies.</p><p><strong>6</strong> Though gorillas are equipped with gigantic muscles and long canine teeth, the animals come to blows only rarely. Wright believes this is at least partly because chest-beating allows males to size each other up without getting physical. \"Even if you're likely to win a fight, there is still quite a high-risk factor,\" he says. \"These are large, powerful animals that can do a lot of damage.\" To smaller males, the sound of a silverback's chest-beat may discourage them from approaching. __27__, a silverback may hear the beats made by a smaller male nearby and decide that he's too puny to bother with.</p><p><strong>7</strong> Because chest-beat peak frequency syncs up with body size - which is itself linked to dominance and reproductive success - female gorillas have plenty of reasons to listen in on the displays, too. Particularly impressive chest-beating might lure females away to a nearby group like a siren's song, though this has not yet been studied. Considering the new study's results, the next step is to see how other gorillas use the information encoded in chest-beating sounds, Salmi says. \"It will be very interesting to see how hearing chest beats in their environments might affect their movements and decision-making as to which areas of their home range to use.\"</p><small>nationalgeographic.com, 2021</small>"

A student asked him if he could create miso from bugs. Noda, an avid traveler who had tried insects overseas, found the bugs rich in protein, like soybeans, so using them instead of beans would make no difference.</p><p><strong>3</strong> In 2018, he produced miso from crickets and grasshoppers. The following year, Noda presented soup flavored with the insect miso at an event for young entrepreneurs. There, he met an official from Antcicada, a restaurant in Tokyo's Chuo Ward that is famous for its cricket ramen²). Antcicada was already considering creating soy sauce with crickets, __30__ it asked Noda to work together on the new product.</p><p><strong>4</strong> The two-spotted cricket, which has a \"strong savory and aromatic flavor,\" and the house cricket, characterized by its \"delicate and elegant taste,\" were used. These crickets were turned into powder and treated with rice malt and salt in wooden buckets at Noda Miso Syoten. No soybeans were used in the production.</p><p><strong>5</strong> A 100-milliliter bottle of the soy sauce uses 480 crickets and carries a price tag of 1,640 yen (\\$15.67) after tax. It is relatively expensive because crickets are 10 to 20 times more costly than soybeans, according to Noda. If wider insect consumption leads to increased cricket production, the price could be lowered.</p><p><strong>6</strong> Eating insects has been seen as a way to resolve world hunger problems because bugs are full of nutrients and require less land and water compared with animals. \"Insects are the most familiar species on Earth and make up an overwhelming proportion of living creatures both in types and numbers,\" Noda said. \"Their potential is high as a new edible material.\" He continued, \"The soy sauce's taste can be realized only with crickets. Soybeans may be much cheaper and easier to process, but I want to show how impressive these unknown tastes are.\"</p><p><strong>7</strong> The cricket soy sauce is available at Noda Miso Syoten and the shopping site of Antcicada at https://antcicada.shop.

Unable to distinguish the volume and pitch of his voice, he struggled with his speech and a vocal coach was brought in to help.
