        "inhoud_html": "<p><em>adapted from an article by Ashley Morgan</em></p><p><strong>1</strong> The internet today is a source of seemingly endless amounts of easily digestible material. Countless people contribute to its 'factual' information, and promote their own opinions as facts too. Through Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, people particularly celebrities are also able to promote products and ideas in a much more immediate and visual way. In addition, they can frame or reinvent themselves as experts in completely different areas than the ones they gained fame in. They have broken away from the activities that made them famous - acting, singing, or sport - and reinvented themselves as business people. They are now more than just promoters of certain products. They are the 'go to' for fashionable lifestyles.</p><p><strong>2</strong> That celebrities are moving into business is not such a surprise. Yet, the way in which they adopt expertise in matters on which they have no training is a new twist in the rise of the amateur. When Victoria Beckham, former member of pop group the Spice Girls, first launched her clothing line in 2008, fashion editors were ready to be sceptical, but influential magazines such as Harper's Bazaar and Vogue were impressed. Despite no apparent training in design - her initial 'expertise' in this matter came from her personal interest in clothing and being photographed wearing fashionable clothes - Beckham recently celebrated a decade as a fashion designer.</p><p><strong>3</strong> __8__, actress Gwyneth Paltrow is now a lifestyle and 'health' guru and her 'modern lifestyle brand' GOOP sells face-creams and other products under the umbrella of health and beauty. Despite the chorus of criticism against Paltrow and GOOP's 'pseudo- science', the company is now reportedly worth US\\$250m.</p><p><strong>4</strong> These new experts don't even have to be famous for another reason to demonstrate expertise. Ella Mills, for example, is a UK blogger who, through documenting her illness and experimenting with food, became a staunch advocate of 'clean eating'. This helped launch her 'natural and honest' food brand, Deliciously Ella, without any experience as a dietitian.</p><p><strong>5</strong> While social media can be considered a force for good in education, the dominance of a 'point of view approach' in this sphere rather than true expertise __10__ expert knowledge itself, and the idea that you spend time to train and gain qualifications in a chosen field before claiming expertise. Besides, as more people turn to the internet and social media for knowledge of all kinds, it might arguably be much harder to tell 'point of view approach' from empirical and factual research, as they now both appear in the same place. A recent example of this is the wider proliferation of pseudo-science. Pseudo-science itself is based on amateur opinions, and the issue with this is that social media becomes the supreme platform for perpetuating it.</p><p><strong>6</strong> As social media has proved that people can be successful with no obvious qualifications or training, and viewpoints that are presented increasingly confirm people's perspectives, scientific expertise might arguably be eroded. While many people have benefitted financially and in terms of social status, the knowledge that has emerged from social media is increasingly narrow and difficult to gauge.</p><small>theconversation.com, 2019</small>"

        "titel": "Reading Faces: Why You Sometimes Get It Wrong",
        "inhoud_html": "<p><em>adapted from an article by Frank T. McAndrew PhD</em></p><p><strong>1</strong> Hundreds of studies over the past 50 years reveal that most of us can quickly and accurately distinguish basic emotional expressions from each other, even when the expression is present for as little as a tenth of a second. It is also well accepted that displaying emotion through the face is a universal, innate part of who we are. In other words, humans everywhere use the very same expressions to convey the very same feelings. There is even an area of our brain that is devoted solely to recognizing facial expressions. So why do we sometimes get it wrong?</p><p><strong>2</strong> For starters, we simply are not always looking. In our interactions with others, it would be considered __14-1__ and more than a little bit creepy to stare fixedly at the face of the person with whom we are speaking. We look at others more when we are listening than when we are the ones speaking, but in either case, we frequently glance away. This means that we may miss very brief microexpressions that come and go in a fraction of a second, and these microexpressions will often reveal our partner's true feelings because they are less easy to control than more obvious emotional signals.</p><p><strong>3</strong> Also, the 'Display Rules' that are part of your culture's repertoire of __14-2__ norms dictate that it is not always appropriate to show exactly what you are feeling. Display rules differ from culture to culture, with some cultures permitting more flexibility than others regarding the range and intensity of emotions that are acceptable in public. Every culture, however, has consistent expectations about how the public display of emotion should be handled.</p><p><strong>4</strong> One of my favorite examples of the pressure to act differently than we feel is what you usually see at the end of a beauty pageant or talent competition. Each of these contestants invariably beams with apparent joy at her good fortune, even when they do not win. The social pressure to smile and appear happy is so powerful that cultural norms overwhelm the display of feelings such as disappointment, envy, or anger that would almost certainly be more __14-3__. And the winner, what does she do? She cries! Apparently, leaping up and down with joy and lording the victory over the also-rans is something that our culture has determined to be unseemly.</p><p><strong>5</strong> Also, we have probably all been in situations where a small 'White Lie' is __14-4__: feigning gratitude for a well-intentioned gift that you hated; praising the cooking of the host after a terrible meal; offering encouraging words after the embarrassing karaoke performance of a friend. Anyway, you could say that both display rules and white lies are culturally accepted forms of deception.</p><p><strong>6</strong> Success in many occupations depends greatly upon the ability to manage emotional expressions. Actors, diplomats, lawyers, and sales representatives, among others, would not get very far without this skill. There are a few tried-and-true facial management techniques that we rely upon to keep true emotions hidden. Qualifying is a technique by which you immediately follow a genuine expression that has slipped out with a different expression, as if to say \"pay no attention to what you just saw this is how I really feel.\" Modulating is what you do when you turn the volume of an emotional expression up or down depending upon the circumstance. For example, imagine that you and one of your close friends have both applied to the same graduate school, and you get in but your friend does not. You will of course be happy about your acceptance, but you will almost certainly downplay the extent of your happiness in front of your friend. Falsifying is exactly what it sounds like - you completely fake an emotion by covering up the real expression and displaying a bogus one.</p><p><strong>7</strong> In short, as good as you are at reading the emotions of others, always remember that there will be times when you get the signals wrong and that is __16__ part of social life.</p><small>psychologytoday.com, 2019</small>"

It seemed like we'd been driving forever in our truck camper and we were still in California.</p><p>15 We entered a grove of redwoods that kept the roads in a cool perpetual twilight and not long after came upon a carved wooden cowboy sleeping in a crescent moon, the sign for Happy Trails.</p><p>At the front counter, the woman studied our hair, our clothes.

        "inhoud_html": "<p><em>The Game Maker for The New York Times (Yes! There is a Game Maker) explains.<br/>adapted from an article by Sam Von Ehren</em></p><p><strong>1</strong> Why do people love games? As the Game Maker for The New York Times, I grapple with this question every day. The reductively easy answer is simple: They're fun! But why are they fun? Do they have to be fun? As we dig deeper and deeper, we find more questions. What even is a game? What is fun? My take on the appeal of games is also simple, if paradoxical. Games are a controlled form of freedom.</p><p><strong>2</strong> Games occupy a strange place in our cultural consciousness. Nearly everyone has played a game at some point in their lives. And yet, games are rarely discussed with the same reverence as other media like films or books. For most, games are like chocolate: a guilty pleasure consumed secretly. The game designer Sid Meier once remarked that \"a game is a series of interesting choices.\" Navigating these choices shapes the course of play, laying bare who we are and how we think. Playing a game is an act of exposition.</p><p><strong>3</strong> When you play a game you make several agreements with your opponent. You agree to engage in a voluntary conflict against each other; to follow a system of rules to govern your conflict; and to accept the outcome of those interactions, declaring one the winner and the other a loser. We adhere to these agreements and rules faithfully, committing to and executing the game with little hesitation.</p><p><strong>4</strong> Game designers call this alternate state of being \"the magic circle\". Imagine a circle drawn in chalk on a sidewalk. When we are inside the chalk we are \"playing\" the game. We'll only do what the rules of the game allow. We will try to win. When the game ends, we leave the circle and return to normal. The magic circle is what separates a game from reality. I use the metaphor of a chalk line because the magic circle is not an absolute barrier or even a physical one. We can enter and exit the magic circle freely. We bring our bodies, personalities, and life experiences into the game. We take the memories and experience of the game with us when we leave. The chalk line casts a spell on that space of sidewalk and turns it into a space for playing.</p><p><strong>5</strong> Humans have always been drawn to this trick, finding novel ways to play within their environments. In prehistoric times, humans were playing games with sheep ankle bones called Knucklebones. Players balance a few bones on top of their hands, then toss a few in the air, capturing as many as possible on the way down. Go, a strategy game invented in ancient China, is still played, highlighting part of what is so fascinating about games. Although Go's origin is unclear, many scholars speculate that it was created to teach tactics and strategy. By entering the magic circle to play Go, we give ourselves permission to try, to fail, to lose, and when we stop playing, we carry that experience with us. The same is true for Chess, Poker, or any number of analog games.</p><p><strong>6</strong> Digital games take many of the powers of traditional analog games and ramp up both the rate of interaction and the complexity of the underlying systems, but I often find that analog games are a bit more playful. When playing an analog game, the only limitations are the rules you've agreed to. You can modify them at will, more easily creating playful experiences.</p><p><strong>7</strong> Games sometimes model real-world systems, allowing free exploration of their interlocking processes. The precursor to Monopoly, Elizabeth Magie's The Landlord's Game, was created to model and critique capitalism by giving players an opportunity to feel its failings first hand. It was not very fun, but that's OK. One of the dark secrets of game design is that games don't need to be fun to be meaningful. Games can help us deal with stress and give us the power to transform our living rooms, backyards, and online meetings into different playful realities.</p><small>nytimes.com, 2020</small>"

Claiming to offer refuge to animals in trouble brings visitors through the gates and donations in the mail. Case in point: Oswald's Bear Ranch, a roadside zoo that shamelessly markets itself as a rescue facility, even though it has only taken in three orphaned cubs in the last decade. By contrast, it has bred 13 cubs in the past 24 years and purchased or received 70 others from shady captive-breeding operations for use in photo ops.</p><p><strong>2</strong> This roadside zoo's owner, Dean Oswald, treats vulnerable bear cubs as __28__. In the wild, cubs stay with their mothers for years, and premature separation of cubs from their mothers causes extreme distress to both. Experts believe that a cub's immune system does not fully develop until after about 12 months, but apparently, that's of little concern when there are coffers to be filled. Oswald has taken cubs as young as 6 weeks old to a bar.</p><p><strong>3</strong> Bear cubs can catch common human illnesses such as colds and the flu. Removing them from their mother before the period of natural weaning causes abnormalities in brain development that can lead to stereotypic (neurotic) behavior, compromise natural exploratory and social behavior, and can be detrimental to their mental and physical well-being throughout their lives. Bears avoid contact with humans, whom they perceive as predators, and being forced into close proximity with the public causes them to feel trapped and vulnerable. Such exposure is a constant, never- ending stressor. When not being used as photo props, bears at Oswald's exist in conditions that are incompatible with their needs. Cubs are confined to a concrete-floored enclosure, which can lead to foot injuries and is particularly damaging to young cubs, as their developing musculoskeletal systems are fragile and can easily be injured if they run or jump on a hard surface.</p><p><strong>4</strong> As a Michigan native, I find it infuriating to see this kind of blatant animal exploitation in my home state. __30__ Take notorious tiger abuser Jeff Lowe, who was featured in Tiger King: he lived in Michigan for many years and kept big cats there. When I was a kid, I used to visit a park in nearby Mt. Pleasant. There, a bear named Smoky paced around his cramped pen. He has been dead for a long time, but his suffering motivated me to fight to ensure that other bears would not be sentenced to a life of exploitation.</p><p><strong>5</strong> Bears belong in the woods, not in the arms of the public. If you care about animals, never pay to interact with wildlife. Urge Oswald's to let the cubs and other bears be transferred to legitimate sanctuaries so they can spend the rest of their lives in comfort and peace.</p><small>Mlive.com, 2020<br/>noot 1 PETA = People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</small>"

People need to reflect honestly and thoughtfully on a particular trauma or challenge, and do it in short sessions - 15 to 20 minutes for a minimum of three days is a good place to start.</p><p><strong>4</strong> Expressive writing works because it allows you to take a painful experience, identify it as a problem and make meaning out of it, experts say. Recognizing that something is bothering you is an important first step. Translating that experience into language forces you to organize your thoughts. And creating a narrative gives you a sense of control. But there are a few cautions. Expressive writing isn't a magical cure. It shouldn't be used as a replacement for other treatments. And people coping with a severe trauma or depression may not find it useful to do on their own, without therapy.</p><p><strong>5</strong> Yet it can be a powerful coping tool for many, in large part because it helps combat the secrecy people often feel about a trauma, as well as their reluctance to face emotions. \"The more you __34__, the more trouble you will have with it, because you create a loop of trepidation and apprehension and increasing negative emotions,\" says Brian Marx, a professor of psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine and deputy director of the behavioral science division of the National Center for PTSD.</p><p><strong>6</strong> Why write? Thinking or talking about an event can lead to ruminating, where you become lost in your emotions. But writing forces you to slow down, says Joshua Smyth, distinguished professor of biobehavioral health and of medicine at Pennsylvania State University, who studies expressive writing.</p><p><strong>7</strong> \"The mere act of putting emotions on paper can dampen the neural activity in the threat area of the brain and increase activity in the regulatory area,\" says Annette Stanton, chair of the department of psychology and professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA.

        "titel": "The remarkable history of the word 'hip'",
        "inhoud_html": "<p><em>Lees eerst de opgave voordat je naar de tekst gaat.<br/>adapted from a blog by Tom Dalzell</em></p><p>For more than 110 years, hip has found a prominent place in our slang, reshaping and repurposing itself every few decades to carry itself forward, from the early twentieth century's hip to today's hipster movement.</p><h3>Hep or hip</h3><p>For years hep and hip were used interchangeably. Hep was recorded first, on 9 May 1903, in the Cincinnati Enquirer. The 'aware' sense of hip quickly grew to include 'world- wise', 'sophisticated', and 'up-to-date with trends in music, fashion, and speech'. It expanded to the verb hip in 1932, meaning 'to make aware'. Hip may be a simple, three-letter word, but its etymology (when used in this way) is a mystery. Holloway and Vass suggested in The African Heritage of American English that hip might be derived from Senegalese slaves, for whom xipi in their native Wolof language meant 'to have your eyes open, to be aware'.</p><h3>Hepcats and hipsters</h3><p>Hep gave way to hepcat, meaning a knowledgeable and fashionable jazz aficionado. In the September 1937 issue of Downbeat, a caption over a picture showing three male musicians and a female singer reads: '3 Hep Cats and a Hep Canary.' It was not until 1940 that we saw hipcat, meaning the same thing. This was also the case with hepster and hipster - hepster first appeared in the title of Cab Calloway's Hepster's Dictionary, punning no doubt on the rhyme with 'Webster'. Hipster would not appear until 1940, although it would soon outpace hepster in popularity. Both terms referred to a white fan of jazz, and usually of jazz played by black musicians.</p><h3>Hippie</h3><p>Next came the early sense of hippie. In the 1950s, hippy or hippie took on a somewhat derisive tone when applied to those who posed as hipsters but were not in fact the genuine article. The first use of hippie in a new 1960s countercultural/flower child sense came in a series of articles on the evolving Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco by Michael Fallon which began running in the San Francisco Examiner on 5 September 1965. Still using beatnik in the headline, Fallon used hippies, heads, and beatniks interchangeably in the body of the article.</p><h3>Hip-hop</h3><p>A tad over a decade later, hip showed up in hip-hop, referring to a subculture that originated in the black and Hispanic youth of America's inner cities, especially in the South Bronx neighborhood of New York in the late 1970s. The word hip-hop, like many of its slang giant peers, has several claimed parents, but no solid evidence supporting any of the claims. The earliest recorded usage found to date is from nine years after DJ Kool Herc began the experiments that produced the art form, in the 1979 song Rapper's Delight, with 'Said a hip hop the hibbit the hippidibby hip hip hoppa you don't stop'. Out of the scat context, the earliest usage is from the 24 February 1979 New Pittsburgh Courier, which reported that DJ Starski was \"responsible for the derivation of the 'Hip-Hop'.\"</p><h3>Hipster</h3><p>Almost a century into its journey through American slang, hip had at least one more life up its sleeve in the form of the new hipster movement, referring to relatively affluent young Bohemians living in gentrifying neighborhoods. It is an opaque term, and one which is generally not used by anyone considered by others to be a hipster.</p><p>All in all, hip has had a remarkable and unusual slang life. Slang is usually short- lived and while there are examples of words that have risen, fallen, and risen again (groovy, sweet and tasty all come to mind), hip is unique in its ability to navigate 110 years, adding suffixes every few decades to emerge fresh and new. It has been a long and strange trip for hip, and there is nothing to suggest that there won't be a new hip variant again soon.</p><small>blog.oup.com, 2015</small>"
